So you know when youre in a rural area at night and the moon isnt visible and you can see a ton of stars

In those optimal circumstances youre looking at around 2500 stars at most Thats about 1100000000th of the total stars just in our own galaxy

Speaking of which take another look above at our gorgeous Milky Way To help understand just how insanely big it is here are a few facts

 The diameter of the Milky Way is 100000 light years A light year is the distance light travels in a year Considering light can travel around the Earth seven times in a second a light year is a mindbogglingly large distance It would take our fastest spacecraft 18000 years to travel one light year And with the Milky Way were talking about 100000 of them

 That also means that if you use a telescope to see a star on the far side of the galaxy youre actually seeing what the star looked like 100000 years ago since the light that left the star then is just reaching us now Likewise if at this moment someone on the other side of the galaxy is checking out the Earth with a telescope theyll see a bunch of early humans and Neanderthals running around clubbing each other like fools
 You might think that when you look closely at that above picture of the Milky Way one of those little dots might be our sun In fact if you expanded the above photo to be the size of the Earth youd still need a microscope to be able to see our pinprick of a sunif the Milky Way were the size of the Earth the sun would be about 150th of a millimeter in diameter

Massive And all in all the Milky Way contains between 100 and 400 billion stars

And thats just one galaxy

In 1995 scientists picked out a little section of the night sky that was unusually devoid of stars To the naked eye and even in a normal telescope this region looked empty and black And the section was tinyit covered the same amount of sky that a tennis ball would cover if it were 100 meters above you and the image on the right shows the size of the region in comparison to the size of the moon in the sky at night

The scientists used the Hubble Telescope to take a 10day long exposure of the empty region to find out what was out there deep in the blackness 

To be clear nothing in this photo is a star Each thing you seeeven the faintest little dotis an entire galaxy There are over 10000 in this image each one containing around 100 billion stars And again this is all in a pinpoint little square of the night sky

Scientists used the info from this photo to postulate that the observable universe contains over 100 billion galaxies which puts the total stars in the observable universe at somewhere between 1022 and 1024 or around 100 sextillion stars

To put that in perspective people at the University of Hawaii spent an unreasonable amount of time calculating an estimate for the number of grains of sand in the world75 quintillion or 75 x 1018

That means that for every grain of sand on Earth there are about 10000 stars in the universe
